# MyElixir
This repository hosts the source files of my endeavors with Elixir. I have tried to document all the exercises I have done with Elixir along with the basic concepts obtained from various tutorials on the internet.  

## What really is Elixir?

Erlang VM powered dynamic, functional programming language that boasts to be:

1. Distributed
2. Fault-Tolerant
3. Soft-Real-Time
4. Hot-Code-Swapped.

## How to run Code?

1. Run it as a script: `elixir <name>.exs` and call functions(if not already called in script).
2. Interactively executein shell: enter `iex` and type code.
3. Compile modules using: `elixirc` and run `iex`.
